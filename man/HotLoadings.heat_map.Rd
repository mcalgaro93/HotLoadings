\usage{
HotLoadings.heat_map(
  PSOBJ,
  format = c("short", "last", "long", "none"),
  data.splsda,
  Y_name,
  component,
  n_top = 15,
  sample_name,
  offset = 0.005,
  order = TRUE,
  facet_formula = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PSOBJ}{A phyloseq object.}

\item{format}{"last" if only the deepest taxonomic characterization is needed.
"long" if all taxonomic levels are needed. "short" if last 2 known taxonomic
levels are needed. "none" for the SV/OTU number only.}

\item{data.splsda}{A sPLS-DA object from mixomics.}

\item{Y_name}{A character string indicating which is the variable associated with component specified. Must be a dicothomous variable.}

\item{component}{A character string containing sPLS-DA's component name.}

\item{n_top}{An integer number indicating how many top associated features to keep. (Default = 15)}

\item{sample_name}{A character string indicating which is the variable with sample names.}

\item{offset}{A value indicating the amount of justification from axis for possible plots. (Default = 0.005)}

\item{order}{A boolean value indicating if the loadings should be separately ordered by positives and negatives (Default = TRUE). If FALSE loadings are ordered using their absolute value.}

\item{facet_formula}{A formula for facetting (default is NULL).}
}
\value{
The function plots heatmap for \code{n_top} features in rows and samples in columns.
}
\description{
The user need to be at the end of mixOmics pipeline.
