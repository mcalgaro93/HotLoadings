Description: A simple way to add information to mixomics loadings.
    Creates nice to see feature names in different formats starting from a phyloseq object.
    Computes mean relative abundances of top n features and compares abundance between 2 condition.
    Adds ordered heatmap next to loadings plot in order to obtain a complete representation of top associated features and their presence in samples.
